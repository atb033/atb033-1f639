## What is Sarvanga Abhyangam?

Sarvanga Abhyangam is a marma massage technique involving the application of medicated oil all over the body with a specific pressure at each marma point. The pressure applied depends on the nature of the ailment as well as the point of application. The combined action of the medicines, temperature, and the force applied at the marma points removes blocks in energy channels called shrotas and ameliorates vata dosha.

Vata, one of the three fundamental doshas, constituted by space and air is the energy of movement. It controls the blood flow, elimination of wastes, breathing and the movement of thoughts across the mind. With aging, vata constitution increases in a person, leading to the deterioration of its associated functions. Being the finest method to balance vata in an individual, Sarvanga Abhyangam has been practiced for centuries to cure ailments related to motion.

## Why do we use it?

We follow the Agasthya Marma school of thought and use this technique mainly to correct orthopedic conditions. Abhigatha (injury or impact) in marma points can lead to poor blood circulation in the associated region. This causes weakness of joints which finally manifest as joint pain. For instance, a major injury (such as a fall from a height) or a minor injury over a long period of time (such as bad posture) in the back can affect the three major marmas present there. 

During Sarvanga Abhyangam, our skilled therapists trigger the specific marma points to restore the blood circulation and correct the misalignments in bone-structure (typically spine, knee and/or shoulders). This treatment, which is usually carried out during the first half of our 14-21 day treatment, is followed by other methods that reinforce the corrected alignment.

## Other benefits

Apart from orthopedic disorders, Abhyangam smoothens the skin and improves its luster, reduces body exhaustion, promotes vasodilation, improves peripheral circulation, maintains proper tension of muscles and tendons, promotes the functional ability of nerves, strengthens the body and gives longevity. It is also very effective in neuromuscular disorders like hemiplegia, paraplegia, and sciatica and degenerative conditions like lumbar spondylosis, and cervical spondylosis.
